things to do:
- check and correct alignment on val_y and prediction
- add more data
- transformer: understand if periodic/non-periodic time embedding is necessary
- bayesian optimization or grid search on optimizer hyperparameters
- upload dataset on public hosting

trasformer hyperparamter analysis:
- repeat experiment with epoch > 1 for avoiding noise of not optimal initialization
- current best param d_k=121 d_v=47 ff_dim=219


things to show in report:
training/evaluation loss to detect overfitting
precision of prediction depending of distance from last ground truth
(also depending of timestep number)
experiment with different rain measurement
graph on precision based on number of past years data
