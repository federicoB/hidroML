timeofyear 20 epoch,
epoch 1 val_loss: 0.0024
epoch 2 val_loss: 0.0032
epoch 3 val_loss: 0.0031
epoch 4 val_loss: 0.0021
final 20 val_loss: 0.0012

no timeofyear 4 epoch:
epoch 1 val_loss: 0.0060
epoch 2 val_loss: 0.0029
Epoch 3 val_loss: 0.0019
Epoch 4 val_loss: 0.0024

things to do:
- check and correct alignment on val_y and prediction
- find a way to proper use timeofyear (maybe valuation on 2 year)
- encapsulate input loading/ feature engineering
- add as output and input also river level

    https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/421935/what-exactly-are-keys-queries-and-values-in-attention-mechanisms
- change data to variation

things to show in report:
training/evaluation loss to detect overfitting
precision of prediction depending of distance from last ground truth
(also depending of timestep number)
experiment with different rain measurement
