things to do:
- norm layer on lstm try to get best result, to find limit to lstm, consider also performance
- check and correct alignment on val_y and prediction
- add more data
- transformer: understand if periodic/non-periodic time embedding is necessary
- bayesian optimization or grid search on optimizer hyperparameters
- upload dataset on public hosting

trasformer hyperparamter analysis:
- repeat experiment with epoch > 1 for avoiding noise of not optimal initialization
- current best param d_k=121 d_v=47 ff_dim=219


things to show in report:
training/evaluation loss to detect overfitting
precision of prediction depending of distance from last ground truth (step ahead)
(also depending of timestep number (sample_lenght))
experiment with different rain measurement
graph on precision based on number of past years data
