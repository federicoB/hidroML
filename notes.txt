things to do:
- check and correct alignment on val_y and prediction
- find a way to proper use timeofyear (maybe valuation on 2 year)
- is good to use rolling averange?

- change data to variation

things to show in report:
training/evaluation loss to detect overfitting
precision of prediction depending of distance from last ground truth
(also depending of timestep number)
experiment with different rain measurement
